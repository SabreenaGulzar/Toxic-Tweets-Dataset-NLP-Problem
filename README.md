For an NLP problem like the Toxic Tweets dataset, the process typically involves the following steps:
## Step 1: Load the Toxic Tweets Dataset
First, load the dataset, which should have at least two columns: the text of the tweet and the label (indicating whether the tweet is toxic or not).

# Step 2: Preprocess the Text
Preprocessing involves cleaning the text by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and removing stopwords.

# Step 3: Convert Text to TF-IDF
Next, convert the preprocessed tweets into a TF-IDF representation using TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn.

# Step 4: Train a Classification Model
Letâ€™s train a simple Logistic Regression model to classify the tweets as toxic or not.

# Step 5: Build a Simple Streamlit App for Deployment
Finally, you can deploy the model using Streamlit to allow users to input tweets and get predictions.
